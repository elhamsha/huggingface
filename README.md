# Hugging Face NLP & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains projects and experiments using **Hugging Face's transformers** for **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning**. It includes fine-tuning, inference, and deployment of transformer models for various tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- 🤖 **Fine-tuning & training** of Hugging Face models  
- 📊 **Text classification, summarization, sentiment analysis, and more**  
- 🔍 **Model inference & evaluation**  
- ☁️ **Deployment with APIs & cloud services**  
- ⚡ **Optimized for performance & scalability**  

## 📂 Projects Included
### 1️⃣ **Text Classification**
   - Fine-tunes transformer models for sentiment analysis & topic detection  

### 2️⃣ **Summarization**
   - Uses models like BART/T5 to generate concise text summaries  

### 3️⃣ **Custom Model Deployment**
   - Deploys models as APIs using FastAPI or Flask
